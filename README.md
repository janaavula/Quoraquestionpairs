# Description

Quora is a question-and-answer site where questions are asked, answered, edited, and organized by its community of users in the form of opinions. The main goal of the project is to improve Quora User (question seeker, answer writer) Satisfaction. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Currently, Quora uses a Random Forest model to identify duplicate questions. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to tackle this natural language processing problem by applying advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not. Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.
